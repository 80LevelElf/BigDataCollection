1) Rewrite a lot of methods as multythread
2) Rewrite code with Paralell
3) Look Task Scheduler

Current:
Add last changed index to BlockStructure. Now:
1) We can use it in BinarySearch if our index is in "proved" part of block structure
2) We can use it LinearSearch - start with last known blockStructureIndex and move on.
And most of all - after such moving we can restore BlockStructure
